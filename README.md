# Overview
---
This library will contain tree structure class templates.
These should be entirely compatible with the c++ containers
library. C++ doesn't have interfaces, so this project aims
to get as close as possible by implementing all functionality
of any container, and allowing differently typed data through
templates. 

The end goal is to provide efficiently implemented tree data
structures that should be easy to utilize in any project.


# Roadmap
---
* Base class tree/generic-tree (Week 2).
* Binary Trees at least mostly implemented (Week 3).
* 2-3-4 Trees implemented (Week 6).
* Some other advanced tree structure by the end of the term (Week 8).
