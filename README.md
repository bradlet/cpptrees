cpptrees
=======
A tree data structure library for c++, made to be
compatible with the GNU compiler.

Copyright Â© 2019 Bradley Thompson


## Overview
---
This library will contain tree structure class templates.
These should mimic the C Standard Template Library's 
Containers.

The end product should provide most of the common
functionality in an STL container. Therefore, the 
end goal will be efficiently implemented tree class
templates that should be easy to utilize in any project.


## Roadmap
---
* BST complete by end of term
---
#### Development planned to be implemented after Summer 2019:
* Refactor to use a single-inheritance hierarchy
* 2-3-4 Trees implemented.
