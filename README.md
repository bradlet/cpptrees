# Overview
---
This library will contain tree structure class templates.
These should act as an expansion to the C Standard Template
Library.

The end product should provide most of the common
functionality in an STL container. Therefore, the 
end goal will be efficiently implemented tree class
templates that should be easy to utilize in any project.


# Roadmap
---
* BST mostly complete (end of week 4).
  1. At this point, either refactor and make a generic tree base, or:
* 2-3-4 Trees implemented (Week 6).
* By end of the term:
  1. R-B Tree implemented, or
  2. refactored to be a tree heirarchy.
