# Overview
---
This library will contain tree structure class templates.
These should be entirely compatible with the c++ containers
library. C++ doesn't have interfaces, so this project aims
to get as close as possible by implementing all functionality
of any container, and allowing differently typed data through
templates. 

The end goal is to provide efficiently implemented tree data
structures that should be easy to utilize in any project.


# Roadmap
---
* BST mostly complete (end of week 4).
  1. At this point, either refactor and make a generic tree base, or:
* 2-3-4 Trees implemented (Week 6).
* By end of the term:
  1. R-B Tree implemented, or
  2. refactored to be a tree heirarchy.
